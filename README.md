<h1 align="center"> Podac </h1>

Podac is an elegant extension to brighten up Chrome's new tab page. It was a built as a solution to common problem facing new tab extensions today: over-complication. A new tab page has never been used for much more than a Google search. So why should it stand in the way of that and clutter up your page with widgets and features you'll never use? Simplicity speaks truth.
