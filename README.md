## Description

Brighten up your new tab page with beautiful images and bookmarks UI.

Built as a solution to a prevalent problem of new tab extensions today: over-complication. A new tab page has never been used for much more than a Google search. So why should it stand in the way of that and clutter up your page with widgets and features you'll never use? The simplicity of Podac's design allows user to navigate their way on the net, without distractions.
